  % \textbf{A look back:} In the previous (February 23, 2016) Breakout Session you practiced differentiating inverse functions.

  % \textbf{Overview:} In today's (February 25, 2016) Breakout Session you'll be introduced to an important application of derivatives: related rates.
  
  % \textbf{A look ahead:} In the next (March 1, 2016) Breakout Session you continue to practice related rates and learn another important application of derivatives: locating local extrema.

\section{Notes for problem 1}
Some students may forget that the variables are with respect to time: so they may write $x' = 1$ instead of $dx/dt$.
Remind the students that often the variables are functions of some other parameter, but we donâ€™t explicitly mention this when writing our equation.

Also, some students may be tempted to substitute too early.
Suggest students work problem 3 and that usually substitution is one of the last steps we apply when solving related rate problems.

\section{Notes for problem 2}
This will be a difficult problems for students to answer since it only gives one number and asks students to make a qualitative comparison between two rates of change.
When solving I suggest you draw the picture and make the connection to the Pythagorean Theorem.
