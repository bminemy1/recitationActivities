\section{Notes for problem 1}
This is a good warmup problem to test if students can identify the
``inner'' function and the ``outer'' function.
For time, I suggest you only work through one part.

\section{Notes for problem 3}
This will be a difficult but good problem for students to work through.
Be explicit in showing how the values of the derivatives are computed.
It may be helpful to build a table of values based off the graph.

\section{Notes for problem 4}
As usual when solving tangent line problems, stress the importance of finding the slope (using derivatives), finding a point on the line, and writing the final answer in point-slope form.

\section{Notes for problem 5}
Stress which function is the ``inner'' function and which function is the ``outer'' function.
This problem will test students ability to recognize composition of functions and application of the chain rule to functions whose formulas look similar but are different.

\section{Notes for problem 6}
When solving this problem itâ€™s helpful to use the story in the solutions to illustrate the problem.
I read it to my class last semester and I think they both enjoyed it (in a humerous way) and it helped them understand what is going on as well.
