\section*{Warm up:} 
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item  \emph{5 minutes}:  Ask students to think about the Warm-Up as they are waiting for class to begin.  Then discuss the warm-up as a class when class begins.
	
	
	
	\end{itemize}


\section*{Problem 1:}

	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item  \emph{8 minutes}:  Divide the problems in \#1 between the groups and let the students work in groups to solve the problems.  You may have to give groups with (a) the hint that $\sin (-x)=-\sin (x)$ because it is odd.
	
	\item  \emph{7 minutes}:  Have students present solutions to \#1.
	
	\end{itemize}



\section*{Problem 2:}

	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item  \emph{10 minutes}:  Allow students to work on \#2 in groups.  Have each group do both parts.
		
	\item  \emph{10 minutes}:  Let groups present their solutions to each part.
			
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	
\section*{Problem 3:}

	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item  \emph{10 minutes}:  Divide the problems in \#3 between the groups and let the students work in the groups to solve the problems.
	
	\item  \emph{5 minutes}:  Go over the solutions for \#3.  Have students present if there is time.
	
	\end{itemize}
